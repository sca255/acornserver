# About

Private BitTorrent tracker, designed from the ground up for music. Fixes some of the annoyances with, and improves upon some of the features of, extant tracker software (such as [Gazelle](https://whatcd.github.io/Gazelle/)). Under heavy development.

Multiple artists with the same name all get different pages, owing to a well-typed separation between:

* artists (who may have any contributory relationship to a release group: such as "composer", "producer", "main", and so on)
* release groups (the abstract concept of an release that groups specific releases together, and that many artists may contribute to)
* releases (specific pressings of an album: special editions, alternate editions, and so on)
* torrents (an encode of a release)

The upload page is dynamic. Typing in the name of an artist brings up an autocomplete function, which allows one to select from a list of pre-existing release groups and releases for said artist.

Torrents can be uploaded from any page, with the relevant details filled in on the upload page. For example:

* One can click "Upload Release Group" on an artist's page, to skip the artist part of the upload page, and directly add a new release group to the artist, a new release to the release group, and torrent to the release.
* One can click "Upload Release" on a release group's page, to skip the artist and release group part of the upload page, and directly add a new release to the release group and torrent to the release.
